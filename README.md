# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
first we have to import module numpy as np
### Step 2: 
create a matrix and store the the matrix in a variable using np.array
### Step 3: 
we have to use the inbuilt functions "linalag.inv" in numpy module to find the inverse of the matrix and store it in another variable
### Step 4: 
print the the final transpose of a matrix
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: MOHAMED RIDWAN A
#RegisterNumber:23003133

import numpy as np

A=[[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]]
c=np.linalg.inv(A);
print(c)
```

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
